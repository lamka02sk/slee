## How to install slee?
### npm and yarn
```javascript
npm install slee --save-dev
yarn add slee --dev
```
Then just require it in your project and you are good to go!

### CDN
In case you prefer using CDN services over hosting libraries locally, there is a option to use it.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slee/dist/theme.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slee/dist/slee.js"></script>
or both at once
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slee/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

### Add files manually
If you don't use any package manager and build tools, you can still download `dist/` files manually and include them
in your HTML.

## Usage / How to?
It's pretty simple. You don't have to be genius to use this library. Anyone can!

Slee supports 5 type of notifications: Neutral, Informative, Success, Warning and Danger (or something went wrong).

### Initialization
The first step is to configure and prepare Slee globally:
```javascript
Slee.configure({
    // ...options go here...
});

// and then
Slee.prepare();
```
Settings are saved and then used for every instance, if they are not overridden locally. Initial configuration is not
required at all. You can configure each instance manually, but we strongly recommend global configuration as it could
save a lot of lines of code.

### Methods
Methods are used to create new Slee instances or configure and prepare library before usage.

#### `configure(options)`
Used to configure the library globally, so you don't have to pass the same settings to every instance. You can also use
method `prepare()` instead.
```javascript
Slee.configure({});
```

#### `prepare(options)`
Prepares library before the first use. It can be also use to configure library. If so, you don't have to use `configure()`
method.
```javascript
Slee.prepare({});
```

#### `success(options)`
Creates notification of the success type. Usually used after successful action.
```javascript
Slee.success({});
```

#### `info(options)`
Creates notification of the informative type. Usually used to inform user about something useful.
```javascript
Slee.info({});
```

#### `warning(options)`
Creates notification of the warning type. Usually used to get users attention.
```javascript
Slee.warning({});
```

#### `error(options)`
Creates notification of the danger type. Usually used to inform user, that something went wrong.
```javascript
Slee.error({});
```

#### `neutral(options)`
Creates notification of the neutral type.
```javascript
Slee.neutral({});
```

#### `create()`
This method is a little bit special. It does not takes any parameters, but only uses those defined with `configure()`
or `prepare()` methods.
```javascript
Slee.create();
```

...aaaand that's all! No more methods.
